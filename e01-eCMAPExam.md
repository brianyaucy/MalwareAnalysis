## Reverse Engineering

**Question**

You are required to reverse engineer all the files that are related to the malware sample, whether they were given to you or downloaded by the malware. 

You need to identify them and reverse engineer them to understand what they do. You are not required to reverse every single part of them, but at least their main functionality. 

Explain all the APIs that are used, how they are used and make sure you reference them with their online documentation found at the MSDN.

<br/>

## Running the malware

**Question**

You are required to dynamically analyze the malware sample(s) and provide thorough details to what it does. Use the questions below to guide you through your analysis.

1. Explain what happens upon execution (effect) and why?
2. If the malware is applying any anti-x (debugging, vm, reversing, etc.), how will you bypass those methods? Provide a step by step detailed.
3. What are the processes involved in this malware sample?
