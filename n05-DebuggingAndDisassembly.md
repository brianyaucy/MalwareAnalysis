## Introduction

Debuggers and Disassembly and why we need them:

- Breakpoints, process control, types of breakpoints
- Stepping-in, out, over, etc
- Launch, Attach and the differences
- Debugging 32-bit/64-bit malware
- Debugging DLLs
- Source vs Binary, etc
- Debugger vs. Disassembler

<br/>

For a long time and still, **Reverse Engineering (RE)** is the leading technique for understanding the structure and operations of malicious programs and what they’re programmed to do.

<br/>

As malware is developed to be more sophisticated, reverse engineering tools become more mature and accessible.

<br/>

Malware RE includes disassembling (and decompiling in some cases) malicious programs.

During RE, binary instructions of the program are transformed into code mnemonics (or **higher-level constructs**) so that analysts can see what the program performs and which systems it affects.

By knowing and understanding its operations, engineers can create solutions to mitigate its malicious effects.

<br/>

By reverse engineering the **WannaCry** Ransomware, the efforts to find its spreading mechanism led to discovering the “**kill switch**” technique, which stopped its spread.

<br/>

Several tools can be used to reverse malicious programs. We can classify them based on their functionalities into:

- Disassemblers
- Debuggers
- Decompilers

<br/>

We use debuggers and disassemblers to:

- understand the functionality of malicious programs whose source code is unavailable.
- simplify the process of code analysis.
- determine the nature of the malware and its purpose. For example, is this malware an information stealer, keylogger, rootkit, and so on.
- understand how the system was infected and its impact.
- discover host-based indicators, including filenames and registry keys, which can be used as signatures
- extract network indicators related to the malware. This can be used to find similar infections via network monitoring tools. For example, if the analysis reveals that a malware is contacting a specific IP address, we can use this IP address as a signature to detect other hosts that are contacting this IP address.

<br/>

### Decompiler

**Decompilers** are used to transform binary code into a high-level code (pseudocode), and to generate **high-level code** that is more concise and easier to read and understand.

<br/>

### Debugger

**Debuggers** are used to execute the target program in a controlled manner, i.e., instead of executing the entire binary, you can execute a specific instruction of function.

You can view and change the program’s execution flow to gain insights about the functionality while its running.

Debugger allows the reverser to conduct a dynamic analysis by **controlling particular aspects of the program during its operation**, such as memory areas of the program. This helps to understand the program’s functionality and how it impacts a system or network.

Examples:
- Ollydbg
- Immnuity Debugger
- x64dbg
- GDB
- Windbg

<br/>

### PE Viewer

PE Viewers (stands for “Windows Portable Executable” file format) are used to extract valuable information from executables. They provide functionality such as dependency viewing.

Examples:
- CFF Explorer
- PE Explorer
- PE Bear
- pestudio

<br/>

### Network Analyzers

**Network analyzers** are used to study how a program is communicating with other machines, such as revealing connections made by the program and what data it is trying to send.

While network analyzers might not be a debugger, they do help in your debugging process.

Example:

- Wireshark

<br/>

### Using Debugger with Disassembly

**Disassembler** shows the *program’s state before execution*. We are presented with the program’s **low-level assembly** instructions.

<br/>

**Debugger** shows *memory locations, registers, and functions’ arguments* during execution. It further allows the reverser to change them while the program is running.

<br/>

You can change the program execution using debuggers. This includes:

- Modify a control flag
- Modify an instruction pointer
- Modify the code instructions

- For example, we can **skip a function** - You can avoid a call to a particular function, by setting a breakpoint on the function call and then modify the instruction pointer to point to the instruction that is after the call. *(Note: this may crash the program execution.)*

<br/>

### Launch vs Attach

To start using a debugger, you can either launch a new process or attach it to an existing process.

<br/>

**Launch** is to **run a program** using a **debugger**. The program running stops immediately before the execution of its main entry point after which, control over the paused program is given to the reverser.

<br/>

**Attach** is to **bind a debugger to an already running program**.

- Pause all program's threads
- Commonly used to debug a process thatis infected by malware
- Note that you will **miss the initial actions** of the process that occur before the debugger is attached

<br/>

### Debugging DLLs

To debug a DLL, we need to find its entry point. This can be done by following these steps:

1. Use a debugger to launch or attach the process to a host process.
2. When a DLL is loaded using **x64dbg**, the debugger will drop an executable in the same folder where this DLL is saved. This executable will act as the host process to execute the DLL.
4. When the DLL is loaded, we need to pause the execution at the entry point of the DLL. For example, if a DLL is loaded using **x64dbg**, the execution will pause at the DLL entry point, TLS call back, or the system breakpoint. By unchecking both TLS and system breakpoint, the debugger will pause the execution at the DLL entry point.

<br/>

### Process Control

Debuggers enable the reverser to control or modify the process behavior while it is running.

Using debuggers, you can:

1. Control the program execution
2. Interrupt the program execution via breakpoints

<br/>

Debuggers offer the following functionalities for execution control:

- Continue (Run) execution
- Step into / Step over
- Execute till Rturn / Run until return
- Run to cursor / Run until selection

<br/>

**Continue (Run)**

Using `Continue (Run)`, a debugger will execute program instructions until it reaches a **breakpoint** or an exception occurs.

If you use this option without a breakpoint, the debugger will execute all instructions without granting you any granular control. 

Hence, this option is used in correlation with breakpoints, to pause the execution when a breakpoint is reached.

<br/>

**Single Step**

- Execute 1 instruction
- Slow
- May get bogged with unimportant details

<br/>

**Step Over**

- Execute one instruction; however, if the instruction is a **function call**, then it **finishes the call** and pauses on the instruction after the call.
- Decrease the code amount that need to be analyzed by “stepping over” some functions
- Pay attention not to miss important functionality, especially in a case where the stepped over function is `void` (does not return anything)
- After step over, you can check the program’s resources, such as the CPU register’s current values

<br/>

**Step into**

- Step into, like step over, executes a single command.
- However, step into **enters a function call** when encountered and execution is transferred to the first instruction inside the called function.
- Helps to understand the inner working of a function and not just the return values from it (which again is what step over is doing).

<br/>

**Execute till return**

- The debugger will execute all instructions of the current function until it encounters a return instruction (`ret` or `retn`).
- You may use it in case you stepped into a function accidentally or the function is not interesting and want to get out of it.

<br/>

**Run to cursor**

- Debugger will execute all instructions until it reaches the current location of the cursor or reaches the selected instruction.

<br/>

### Breakpoints

- Debugger allows this feature to interrupt the execution of the program at a particular location.
- A program that is paused at the breakpoint becomes broken.
- For example, if you can’t figure where a call instruction is redirecting the flaw to, add a breakpoint on the call and check the content of the register `EAX`, which will hold the memory location.

- A breakpoint can be set at:
  - Particular instruction
  - Function / API calls
  - Access to memory address (READ / WRITE / EXECUTE)

- You can set several breakpoints in the program; the execution will be interrupted if any of these breakpoints is reached.
  - Example: Adding a breakpoint at a call to `VirtualAllocEx` and then read the return alue in `EAX|RAX`
  - Example: Add breakpoints at other functions like `WriteProcessMemory`

![picture 267](images/a7145b4095849acc6f819796283597c371f821e7b23c89f4131724d1ca80b7cc.png)  

<br/>

There are also several types of breakpoints:

1. Software breakpoint
2. Hardware breakpoint
3. Memory breakpoint
4. Conditional breakpoint

<br/>

**Hardware Breakpoint**

These registers allow to interrupt the execution of the program using debug registers. The control is transferred to the debugger when memory is accessed for reading or writing.

<br/>

The CPU debug registers are eight registers, **DR0-DR7**.

- **DR0-DR3**: breakpoint registers: these registers contain the breakpoints line addresses.
- **DR4-DR5**: reserved
- **DR6**: debug status: indicates the activated breakpoint.
- **DR7**: debug control: determines the activation mode of the breakpoint via the access mode, whether it is read, write, or execute.

<br/>
<br/>

**Software Breakpoint**

The debugger overwrite the first byte of the instruction with the `INT 3` instruction (the `0xCC` opcode). Upon trigger, control is transferred from the program to debugger.

You can set **unlimited** number of software breakpoint. However, advanced malware searches for the breakpoint instruction, `INT 3`, and if found, the malware changes its normal behavior (e.g. performs something non-malicious to avoid detection during a debugging session).

<br/>
<br/>

**Memory Breakpoints**

Used to interrupt the execution if the memory is accessed (for read or write).

Useful in case you want to inspect when a specific memory address is accessed and by which instruction.

<br/>
<br/>

**Conditional Breakpoints**

- Break in case a condition is satisfied.
- Cause slowness
- This feature is offered by the debugger, not a feature of instructions or CPU, hence you can determine a condition for software or hardware breakpoints.

<br/>
<br/>

### Debugging 32-bit / 64-bit Malware

The main difference is that 64-bit malware uses **extended registers**, **64-bit memory addresses/pointers**, and have slightly different conventions for API calling.

<br/>

For 32-bit function, when the arguments are pushed, the stack grows and if they are popped the stack shrinks. 

For 64-bit function, **the space for the stack is allocated at the function beginning and is not modified till the end of the function**. This space is used to store function parameters and local variables.

<br/>
<br/>

### Source Code vs. Binary Debugging

We perform analysis on malicious binary since the source code of this binary is not available.

<br/>

Source-level debugging is performed on the high-level language, and usually this feature is available in the integrated development environments (IDEs).

<br/>

Both allow to pass over the program instructions and to set breakpoints to examine values of memory locations.

<br/>

**Source code analysis** depends on the programming language. Analysis of source code is much easier than analysis of compiled binaries.

<br/>

**Binary debugging** requires **reverse-engineering** and low-level programming skills **(unmanaged code)**.

<br/>
<br/>

### Debugger vs. Assembler

A **debugger** is used to examine and control the execution and internal state of another program. Hence, it offers a dynamic view of the program while it is running.

<br/>

Using debuggers we can get insight about the **program’s functionality while it is runnin**g. Debuggers provide more information about the functionality of a program than the disassembler.

<br/>

Debuggers allow us to examine the** value of memory location, registers contents, and argument** passed to functions.

Also it provides the ability to change the execution of the program..

<br/>

Disassemblers provides a **snapshot** of the program **before the execution** of its first instruction.

## Debugging & Debuggers

### Ollydbg

Free to download:

- http://ollydbg.de/

<br/>

**Ollydbg** is a GUI-based debugger and contains only user level debugging mode. It can extend its features using plugins.

WARNING:
Always run **Ollydbg** as ADMIN! When we do malware analysis, we are interested in seeing what could the malware do when the malware has full privileges. If the goal is to test the overall environment’s security posture with regards to the debugged sample, then you may run it with the privileges of a regular user.

<br/>
<br/>

To load an executable into Ollydbg, use Open (to start a new process and attach to it) or Attach (to already running one):


![picture 268](images/580350734224e22c373b4f0133865bf833e50d4a0ba1a1d42bbad1b92c5ef184.png)  

<br/>

When you select a file, Ollydbg will start the analysis of the file. This is the default view that we are presented with.

<br>

The default view of x64dbg contains the windows shown in the picture below. We can add the target file by drag and dropping it in the debugger, or by selecting `File→ Attach`, or `Alt+A` (then go to its location and open it).

<br/>

**Disassembly Area**

- This area is split into multiple columns. The 1st column shows the address in memory of the instructions. The second column shows opcodes, which is short for “Operation CODES”.
- The 3rd column shows the assembly instructions, which is what matters the most to us. In the 4th column, the debugger displays comments about instructions.

<br/>

**Registers and Flags Area**

- Registers: This window shows CPU Registers, which are used to perform mathematical operations.
- Flags: In assembly language are used to tell the current state of the processor. In x64dbg, individual flag status can be changed by double-clicking on them. Flags play a vital role while doing an analysis of the code.

<br/>

**Dump Area**

- Shows the hex-code of the program in the memory. It is just like a hex editor, which shows the raw data in both hexadecimal & ASCII/UNICODE format. 
- If you want to change something in it, just double-click on that selected portion which you want to change & edit the bytes.

<br/>

**Stack Area**

![picture 301](images/8197f2a57136ec2d37256b1259cc41f0624b7765db4846315a90191fc92c992c.png)  

- The stack is space in memory in, which is temporarily used to store data. 
- It stores data in a particular order – **LIFO** (Last In First Out) or **FILO** (First In Last Out).

<br/>

Before we use the x64dbg, there are a couple of tabs we should discuss, which are used to view the different data. These are:

- CPU: the main view that shows the disassembler view, the memory dump, the registry view… etc:

Events tab is broken into:

- System Breakpoint: When loading a new process, the x64dbg will cause a break in the system function, which initializes the application
- +it is attempting to debug.
- TLS Callbacks: The TLS Callback is a function, which is called before the main application runs. This can set parameters or even be used by certain protectors to implement anti-debug technology. This setting allows you to break execution on this function.
- Entry Breakpoint: This causes x64dbg to break on the Entry point of the application. For generic debugging, this is the only breakpoint you will need to have checked.
- DLL Entry: This will break on the entry point of any DLL, which is loaded by the process you are debugging.
- Thread Entry: This will break on the first instruction of any new thread initialized by the current process.
- Attach Breakpoint: When this is checked, it will cause x64dbg to break in the DbgUiRemoteBreakin function when attaching to an active process. If unchecked, it will attach without suspending the process.
- DLL Load/DLL Unload: This will break in the system function when a new library(DLL) is loaded into or unloaded from the active process. The DLL Load breakpoint occurs before any of its code is executed.
- Thread Start/Thread End: This allows us to break in system when our debugged application initializes or terminates a thread.
- Debug Strings: Pause when a debug string is emitted by the debugger.

<br/>

Engine these are a few advanced settings for the debugging engine. This should just be left as default in most cases, but here is a rundown of how they work.

- Undecorate Symbol Names: This makes symbol names look cleaner.
- Enable Debug Privilege: This allows you to attach to system processes.
- Enable Source Debugging
- Disable Database Compression
- Save Database in Program Directory
- Enable Trace Record Recording During a Trace: to enable the recording to record the trace.
- Skip INT3 Stepping: skip interrupting the debugger. 
- No Script Timeout Warning: don't show the timeout warning. 
- Ignore Inconsistent Breakpoint: 
- Log If The Thread has Switched: 
- Enable Verbose Exception Logging:
- Disable WOW64 Single Step Workaround: 
- Breakpoint Type: This feature allows you to try different types of breakpoints if your program detects or blocks the default INT3.

<br/>

Exception: You can tell x64dbg the specific exceptions that you like to ignore and pass to the program. Leaving this blank will let x64dbg break on every exception. If you want to ignore all exceptions, add the range 0-ffffffff using the Add Range button. The Add Last button will allow you to add the most recent exception which the program you are currently debugging incurred to the ignore list.

Disasm it’s used to change the appearance of the disassembled instructions.

- Argument Spaces: This will put a space after every argument changing mov rax,rdx to mov rax, rdx. It essentially puts a space after every comma.
- Tab Between Mnemonic and Argument:
- Hide Pointer Size:
- Only Show FS/GS Segments:
- Memory Spaces: This puts a space in between memory reference instructions and their operators. This causes `mov eax, byte ptr ds:[edx+18]` to look like `mov eax, byte ptr ds:[edx + 18]`.
- Uppercase: This changes all of the text to uppercase 
- Auto Comments only on CIP: This will remove all comments, including references from the current disassembly except at the instruction pointer.
- Don’t Highlight Operand 
- Hide Module Name For Local Memory Address 
- Permanent Highlight Mode 
- 0x Prefix For Values 
- Don’t Show Source Line in Comments 
- Maximum Module Name Size

## Diassembly and IDP Pro

This chapter goes over IDA Pro, what it is and everything about using IDA Pro for your analysis.

<br/>

**What is IDA?**

> Directly from the creators: “IDA” is the Interactive DisAssembler: the world's smartest, most feature-full, and most powerful disassembler and debugger. It is used for binary reverse engineering which is a feature rich, crossplatform, multi-processor disassembler and debugger developed by Hex-Rays.”” – Hex-Rays
