## Introduction

You have been asked to create Assembly Code sub-routines and use them in a C++ project.

The goals of this lab are to familiarize yourself with writing Assembly code and give you a push forward into Assembly language coding, as you will need these skills with Malware Analysis. Plus, you can even use these skills in Exploit Development.

After completing this lab, you will have a clear understanding of the following:
* Creating C++ projects that use external Assembly code 
* Converting high-level language code to Assembly Code 
* Managing stacks and use deferent data types in Assembly 
* Optimizing an Assembly cod

## Tools

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 with MASM (used in this lab) 
* NASM. Not used here, but unlike Visual Studio, which is WindowsÂ® only, NASM is a very powerful multi-platform assembler. However, it does not have its own GUI. We use Visual Studio here because it is simpler. After completing this lab, try to repeat the lab with NASM, and see how NASM depends on command line rather than a GUI.
