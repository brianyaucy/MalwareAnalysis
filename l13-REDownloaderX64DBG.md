## Scenario

You have been called by a client to examine a weird sample that was found on one of their developerâ€™s systems. The client thinks this sample could be hiding its true nature of activity.

<br/>

The goal of this lab is to understand how to both debug and reverse engineer a downloader which is widely used by different threat actors.

<br/>

After completing this lab, you will be able to use a disassembler, such as IDA Pro, to reverse engineer a downloader. You will also be able to use a debugger, such as x64dbg, to debug the same downloader and understand what malicious activity is being carried by this downloader.

## Task 1: General Sample Information

**Question**

Gather general information about the sample using only a debugger.

<br/>

**Answer**

First load (open) the sample into **x64dbg**.

Note:
Attach = Load a running process
Open = Load an Image

<br/>

First check the **imported and exported APIs** by navigating to the **Symbols** tab:

<br/>

Double clicking `Downloader.exe` on the left will bring us to the disassembly:

## Task 2: Function calls and breakpoints

**Question**

This is a malicious sample that was collected, and you need to Figure out what functions are being used and where to place a breakpoint to control the process.

<br/>

**Answer**

## Task 3" Running the Downloader

**Question**

Determine the IOCs that could be created to find and identify this sample on other systems.

<br/>

**Answer**
