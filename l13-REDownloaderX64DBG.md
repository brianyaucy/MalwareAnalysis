## Scenario

You have been called by a client to examine a weird sample that was found on one of their developerâ€™s systems. The client thinks this sample could be hiding its true nature of activity.

<br/>

The goal of this lab is to understand how to both debug and reverse engineer a downloader which is widely used by different threat actors.

<br/>

After completing this lab, you will be able to use a disassembler, such as IDA Pro, to reverse engineer a downloader. You will also be able to use a debugger, such as x64dbg, to debug the same downloader and understand what malicious activity is being carried by this downloader.

## Task 1: General Sample Information

**Question**

Gather general information about the sample using only a debugger.

<br/>

**Answer**

First load (open) the sample into **x64dbg**.

Note:
Attach = Load a running process
Open = Load an Image

<br/>

First check the **imported and exported APIs** by navigating to the **Symbols** tab:

<br/>

Double clicking `Downloader.exe` on the left will bring us to the disassembly:

<br/>

We can search for strings by `Right-click in the disassembly window > Search for > Current Module > String references`:

<br/>

Since the static analysis has been done before, it is skipped in this part.

## Task 2: Function calls and breakpoints

**Question**

This is a malicious sample that was collected, and you need to Figure out what functions are being used and where to place a breakpoint to control the process.

<br/>

**Answer**

The main reason we use a debugger is to **have control of the execution flow** by adding breakpoints.

<br/>

By default, the debugger will stop at either:

- A system entry
- TLS callback
- The program's entrypoint

<br/>

In the **Symbol** tab, the program's entrypoint is highlighted in <red>red</red> (**Address of Entry Point**) - the red highlight mark means that there is a breakpoint at that address location.

<br/>

Next, double-click `Downloader.exe` on the left to get back to the disassembly.

Then `right-click in the disassembly window > Search for > Current Module > Intermodular calls`.

- New tab titled `Calls`
- Names of the modules are listed in parenthesis on the right
- The first 9 function calls (`ShellExecuteA`, `Sleep`, `URLDownloadToFileA`) are of interest

<br/>

Set breakpoints to the 9 function calls by `right-clicking the function > Toggle Breakpoint` one by one (or you can select the function calls then press `F2`):

<br/>

After that you will see the related addresses highlighted in red:
