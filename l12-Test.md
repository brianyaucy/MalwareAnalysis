# Lab 12 - Reverse Engineering a 64-bit Downloader using IDA Pro

---

## Scenario

You have been called by a client to examine a weird sample that was found on one of their developerâ€™s systems. The client thinks this sample could be hiding its true nature of activity.

<br/>

The goal of this lab is to understand how to both debug and reverse engineer a downloader which is widely used by different threat actors.

<br/>

After completing this lab, you will be able to use a disassembler such as IDA Pro to reverse engineer a downloader. You will also use a debugger such as x64dbg to debug the same downloader and understand what malicious activity is being carried by this downloader.
