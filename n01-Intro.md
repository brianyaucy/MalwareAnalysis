## Skill Requirements

1. System architecture and low-level programming language (assembly)
2. OS & how it works
3. High-level programming languages (e.g. C, C++, Python)
4. Networking & Network Protocols
5. General cybersecurity knowledge

## Malware

Malware = Malicious software

- Describe any malicious program or code that is harmful to systems

<br/>

Common goals of malware:

1. System disruption
2. Data stealing
3. Unauthorized access
4. Espionage
5. Spamming
6. Utilizing the victim's system (e.g. Botnet / DDoS)
7. Ransom

## What is Malware Analysis

Malware Analysis is the art of dissecting malicious software with the obejctive of answering 3 main questions:

1. How does it work?
2. How can we detect it?
3. How can we defeat and eliminate that threat it creates?

<br/>

Malware Analysis is important, especially when determining:

1. The nature of the malware and its goals
2. What behavior and damage it causes
3. What indicators coudl help detect the malware on systems or during its network communication
4. What vulnerabilities were exploited on the compromised machine and how the attacker moved laterally in the network
5. Who the threat is attributed to and if the threat actors still have a foothold on the system / network
6. How to respond to and eliminate the threat

<br/>

While **Malware Analysis** is closely related to **Reverse Engineering**, it does not mean you cannot analyze malware without Reverse Engineer. 

RE is the art of dissecting a product to understand its blueprint and how it was made.
- dissect an unknown file format, a cryptographic algorithm
- crack and break a software's protection mechanism
- reverse malware

## Common Tools Categories

1. File format analyzers
2. System & Network monitoring tools
3. Debuggers / Disassemblers
4. Small gadgets - data converters / decryptors /  editors / registry tools / ...
5. Virtualization tools to create contained environments
6. IDE

## IOC

After finishing analyzing a malware sample, you can write **signatures** to detect the same or similar samples running on other systems.

We call this an **Indictor of Compromise (IOC)**

---

## Types of Malware

1. Viruses (need intervention to infect & spread)
2. Worm (spread itself without intervention)
3. Scareware
4. Ransomware
5. Botnets
6. Trojan
7. Spyware
8. Rootkit (malware conceals the existence of any malicious code in the system)
9. Keylogger
10. Logic bomb
11. Backdoor / Remtoe Access Tool (RAT)
12. Information stealer
13. Downloader
14. Dropper (an executable which has another malware embedded inside it)
15. Adware
